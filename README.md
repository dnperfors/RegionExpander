# RegionExpander

**Project status: Archived**

RegionExpander is a simple VisualStudio extension that automatically expands regions and make them less visible.

For the last few years I didn't have the need to use this extension, therefore I don't want to spend time to update it to VisualStudio 2022. Feel free to open een pull request or fork this project to update it.

## How to install

Using VisualStudio, search for RegionExpender in Tools / Extensions and Updates...
